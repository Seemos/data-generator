# data-generator
A python script that allows for a quick generation of dummy datasets for algorithm visualisation and the evaluation of the functionality of an implementation.

## Clusters
![](images/clusters.png)
2D clusters can be generated by using the *create_clusters_2D* function of *ClusterGenerator*. 3D clusters can be generated using the *create_clusters_3D* function of *ClusterGenerator*. The functions expect the following parameters:
| **Parameter** | Description|
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **num_clusters** | The number of clusters to be generated                                                                                |
| **range_x**      | A tuple that defines the range in which the center of a cluster can be located on the X-axis.                         |
| **range_y**      | A tuple that defines the range in which the center of a cluster can be located on the Y-axis                          |
| **range_z**      | A tuple that defines the range in which the center of a cluster can be located on the z-axis (only 3D clusters)       |
| **range_points** | A tuple that defines the minimum and maximum amount of points that are generated for a cluster                        |
| **max_distance** | The Maximums distance in both dimensions a datapoint can have relative to the center of the cluster it is assigned to |
| **seed**         | (optional) seeds the generation process to be reproducible. Defaults to 42                                            |
